## SENSORS OVERVIEW

This is an overview of the sensors wich are going to be used throughout the installation, the sensors will be visible and give direct feedback to user.



**Light sensor**

This sensor is capable of measuring pressure by means of the membranes processed in the sensor.  
The resistance of the sensor changes based on the pressure on the membrane.



**MAX4466 Microphone Amplifier Module with Microphone**
