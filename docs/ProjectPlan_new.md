**WHAT**

With ever growing data infrastructures such as more internet connectivity and more ways of harvesting data about users by means of more internet connected (Internet of Things) devices, we are willingly being more surveilled than ever before. With the recent announcement of the Metaverse we are heading towards a dystopian, black mirror-like future where every action in our daily live while be recorded, monetised and controlled. 



**WHY**

Systems like IFTTT (If This Then That) are all centralised over just a few platforms (i.e. Google and Facebook). Combined, this collection of passive sensor data provides a clear picture about the daily rituals in the users life. It is important for users to be able to understand or at least see the IoT network within their own household. Because of illegibility of these networks, it is hard for the average user to understand and make decisions about how their data is used.



**HOW**

An installation providing a narrative told by Alexa, this narrative is being triggered by users in the room using sensors. Instead of the voice assistant always listening and responding it will do the exact opposite, reflecting the control tech giants are gaining in our daily rituals. On displays in the room it will show how the data is being used (what kind of data and its destination).

[â†’ Sensors being used](https://github.com/Maximaaal/graduation/tree/main/sensor-experiments)

By showing the user the power of (passive) sensor data collection.

- How is it collected (sensors)
- What is collected (data)
- Where does the collected data go to (Interconnectivity)



## Research question
