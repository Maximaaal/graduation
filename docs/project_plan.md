# Project Plan



## **RESEARCH QUESTION**

### **How much control do sensors have within consumer electronics, what impact is that having on the user?**

Smart devices are becoming more and more integrated in our lives and taking a bigger role in our daily rituals. We are letting big tech companies in our homes as Trojan Horses there to secretly steal our data. All these devices are being connected to the Internet of Things bring new security problems which never existed in the house before. Smart speakers can always listen and cameras will always see what you are doing.

Should we be more aware and knowledgeable of the technologies we are using? Or should the creators of these technologies be more transparent and teach us about it?

Home automation is a collective name for a group of technologies within a household which helps the user for automating everyday tasks. This devices are mostly controlled by either a smartphone or a VUI (voice user interface) such as Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon) or Google voice assistant. These are connected with a system called ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) which is a network consistent of multiple physical devices with the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with each other over the internet.



### **KEYWORDS**

- Privacy
- Sensors
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Information leaks
- Inference attacks (Leaking of machine learning models)



## **METHODOLOGY**

- Researching sensors

Which consumer electronics contain these sensors?

What kind of sensors are being used?

What are the privacy protocols for these sensors?



- Experimenting with sensors

What kind of output values do theses sensors have -> how do these sensors react in different environments



- Visual experimentation

How can I use these sensors to create certain visuals (TouchDesigner, Processing)



- Creating a narrative
